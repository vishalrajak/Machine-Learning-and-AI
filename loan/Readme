Description- Machine learning models deployed on a large data set with around 25 features to predict the policies for loan approval. This prediction helped to decide organizations to approve loan for earning profit. 
Keywords- Supervised Learning, Class imbalance, Classification

Project details- The motive behind implementing this project is to construct a model predicting the loan approval decision based on various features of the applicant borrower. It is an classic business problem in the domain of 
finance and commerce. The data consists of around 25 features and then problem is Supervised learning- Classification. Objective is to predict the approved loan as "Good loan" or "Bad Loan".
